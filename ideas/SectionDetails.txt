MOMENTS

"WONDERLAND"
pictures of Boston blue line Wonderland stop
getting on subway, watching subway windows fly by
sound is mac startup sound, over and over, filtered, delayed


"TEXT POEM"
poem in text messages
html-gl it as water drips or pixelated


"NOW"
	one word ("now"?) in old splattered typewriter text on small white white window
	it vibrates with small sounds
	and a siri voice saying it, but filtered through lowpass
	then a text msg window opens up, says a few small texts of poetry
		then goes berzerk texting rapidly
		a sound for each text
	the text sounds are made rapidly -- with each text
		then are filtered into a pitch
	cuts to a video -- of outside, nature

one wide quicktime player with voice, but then skipping through it to make song
Inspiration from german lieder

sound mimics it: noise filtered into a note that pans

LILYPOND
Generate dozens of images of very complex scores using lilypond, flash them on the webpage one by one.
	don't play them -- only bursts of noise when each hits the page

HEARTBEAT
Beginning:

code scrolling behind it (code of actual page?)
both stutter into color -- heart in color drawing, code in syntax highlighted, still scrolling
what code? (code of the website itself or the js library, on loop?)
