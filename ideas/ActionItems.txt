Next steps
==========


// pixelate images.
// get presence working
		resized to fit(?)
// spruce up client codevis and move to client.html

// increase stage size
// make starting shape (around the presence)
// turn computer loading sounds into indiv mp3 files
// create bird video and test pixelation
pixelation function not working
	look at: 
		// pixelate, 
		size for image canvas 
		//	-- needs auto height for image
			//-- want it to fill screen totally?
			//-- doesn't resize .. ?

			// need to use video.width and video.height when drawing
// presence.kill()

create map multi-point directions text file
create design fiction rapid-fire section w/ noise
	add noise (tick?) to log
create video rapidfire slideshow of lily images?

	// images and videos -- when resizing width (only 1 argument), auto-adjust hieght

connect audio to browser placement when window opens or moves
	create general purpose sine wave (or one in each window?)

examine text overlays --
	visible
	legible
	well-placed

helper funcs: alt("hide()","show()")
or...
hide() || show()
pick("hide()","show()")

NOTE: use letter numbers only with new media ... ???? that way you will not often get to 100, and the rest of the time it doesn't matter....

note: using pixelated videos w/ pixelated presence is too much... use text for presence?

// can't find: load dreaming font page and create it.
// create code for ONE WORD section.
	-- // needs: random timing
	-- // location for each audio player (.move)
	// -- needs: bomb() for media prototype
make controller refresh cause the clients to refresh ... ?
	or have a button that refresh's clients?

// make recursive browsing video

// assemble lilypond images and crunch them
make controller text input area editable

get parsedb connected... ?

bugs:
audio not skipping correctly? what time scale is the input?




get url of netart rain world video and try it in mcluhan
figure out phone ring api tutorial and put in custom website with easy api



Library edits:
Make sounds when windows open
give write() arguments: x, y, color (black or white)
// Add web audio tools
// add vine function in boite
// *could* create a video to canvas processor so that could 	
			// pixelate videos! or have i done this?
perhaps need a second type of audio element which is non-visual which lets you do pitch changing?

// make da json!
	pattern extender
	vine and media links -- a keyword for each URL
	


Known issues:
// Gifs do not show because image is rendered to canvas...
	need a separate gif loader?
wall.empty() should kill any media in the wall.
	also should be chainable. empty().hear().skip()
