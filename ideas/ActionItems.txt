Next steps
==========

// move "frame" out of the way of the code window
find siri in key of E or that sounds OK 
// get movie from phone of my walking, vines of travel
// change wall key code to be wall("line") 
// 	-- i'm only creating it ocassionally anyway. ` can still cycle through them.


bug fixes:
	// autofocus on code input area when page loads in controller
	//skip(0,0.1) doesn't work because starts with 0, needs a ===0
	//in text area, hitting enter needs to reset backlogIndex to -1
	// in text area, typing should be added to backlog[0], which should be empty otherwise
	
	? client onunload should close all windows

test: 
	// r and rf(),
	// wall "low",
	// autoscroll(),
	? make wiki function,
	// ios image,
	// now image,
	// sine and noise


// infinite or cyclic colors for walls

// make sure DJ and Voice have a 'kill' method, and are highlighted

// better quality for reflected.mp3
// turn down window sines
? make sure window sines are panned correctly
//detune dialtone & dials to match vibes in key of E
// dj volume doesn't work
// test all dj functions one by one

make sure "empty" also removes all elements of that wall from m.media and from the audiograph

incorporate new one word:
-l 30 hear("piano"+i%5).move(0,i*27).jumpTo(i%14)
needs be pushed into an array though
====
here:
====
MIX all audio in studio one, using the wavs.
-- make pianos louder
-- make displacement softer
-- make prepareds softer

Revisit TEXT media
// reexamine text overlays
	- randomize placement (via separate function) -- middle, 	corner
	- turn wash and flip into own functions controlled by @, rather than creating own intervals withing wash function
	- wash seems to skip a letter if at 300 ms?

	create design fiction rapid-fire section 
	w/ noise on each play ... but that may be separate
	1 next() && noise.vol(0.8,0,100) @ 100



CALL IT DONE


THEN:
=====

then try to screen capture a performance!

get parsedb connected... ? -- can do after wac
put on heroku -- can do after wac

run as much of the piece as you can!
	look at score and see whats still impossible
	incorporate "material"
	improv with it a bit more, too! (audio) (windows)



lookin great tho!
	"
	i lived across america
	finding life and art
	life does not look like this
	this is life
	everywhere i go
	there is always motion
	there is always noise
	there is always silence
	there is always a medium
	there is always reflection
	there is always connection
	there is always a dream
	"


man, wish i could incorporate!
	paulstretch.js



bugs that can stay until after WAC:
	wall.kill() does not remove it from local.walls within controller.html, nor does it switch the color of the ~ in controller, or change local.context in controller.



// pixelate images.
// get presence working
		resized to fit(?)
// spruce up client codevis and move to client.html

// increase stage size
// make starting shape (around the presence)
// turn computer loading sounds into indiv mp3 files
// create bird video and test pixelation
pixelation function not working
	look at: 
		// pixelate, 
		// size for image canvas 
		//	-- needs auto height for image
			//-- want it to fill screen totally?
			//-- doesn't resize .. ?

			// need to use video.width and video.height when drawing
// presence.kill()

// create map multi-point directions
	-- add into settings.json




// test the phone ring!

// write code score for everything i can so far
// 	fake musical selections and leave gaps as necessary
//then write it for "now" section

// ! proust poem page
// ! no government page

// then make more music to accompany
	// choose a tonic
		// prepared dreams
		//old max patches
		

=============
uuuup next...
=============

// test music to make sure all turned out correctly
	//run in browser too

	
// make client code area look better
	//test out w/ showing in main windows

//close the middle gap in "line" shape to 1-2 px

// then coordination for ongoing performance
	// refresh master = refresh audience
	// or a command? reboot()

// pixelation on video not working right on "birds"
	// starts 100 px down





// connect audio to browser placement when window opens or moves
//	create general purpose sine wave (var sine)
//	create general purpose noise generator in main window (var noise)
//	make window.fx a gain node that all other audio media can connect into that leads directly to the fx chain (rather than connecting to m.pitch.ugen)

// make controller text input area editable



still to do in score:
	// find first sound file to skip (E maj 7 chord? or A maj 7 guit? or la monte young chord?)
	// change random() to r() and rf() (additional to random because random may be used in the code)
	// make wall pattern "4low" (4 small in a row)
	
	// autoxray function
	// make wiki function that bundles "hack" -- not needed? better to just be general.
	// have a text area always writable to, and write in real time?
	// find text for design fiction -- from gutenberg?
	// find text for proust
	// change ios file to jpg
	// make now.jpg
	make general kick function? or use sine with vol?

	

	plan is to...
	// backup voice.js, cassette.js
	integrate mespeak
	// disconnect cassette from mediaelementsource.
		// should also be simple
	// make a new media: dj("piano") or the "dj" media 
		// uses a tone.player? no media element
		// connected through effects
		// just expose the ugen api, basically, using shorthands
	

//	implement && and ||







//morph dell sound (or phone sounds?) into birds then back then into wind

/*
helper funcs: alt("hide()","show()")
or...
hide() || show()
pick("hide()","show()")

what about doing two things at once? 
1 tick() && 2 vol(1,0,1)

*/

NOTE: use new line numbers only with new media ... ???? that way you will not often get to 100, and the rest of the time it doesn't matter....

note: using pixelated videos w/ pixelated presence is too much... use text for presence? or emojis? or...

smaller presence

// can't find: load dreaming font page and create it.
// create code for ONE WORD section.
	-- // needs: random timing
	-- // location for each audio player (.move)
	// -- needs: bomb() for media prototype
// make controller refresh cause the clients to refresh ... ?
	or have a button that refresh's clients?

// make recursive browsing video

// assemble lilypond images and crunch them


bugs:
audio not skipping correctly? what time scale is the input?




get url of netart rain world video and try it in mcluhan
figure out phone ring api tutorial and put in custom website with easy api



Library edits:
Make sounds when windows open
give write() arguments: x, y, color (black or white)
// Add web audio tools
// add vine function in boite
// *could* create a video to canvas processor so that could 	
			// pixelate videos! or have i done this?
perhaps need a second type of audio element which is non-visual which lets you do pitch changing?

// make da json!
	pattern extender
	vine and media links -- a keyword for each URL
	


Known issues:
// Gifs do not show because image is rendered to canvas...
	need a separate gif loader?
wall.empty() should kill any media in the wall.
	also should be chainable. empty().hear().skip()
